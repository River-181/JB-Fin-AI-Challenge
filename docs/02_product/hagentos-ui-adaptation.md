# HagentOS UI Adaptation

This update expands JB LocalGuard OS from a simple 3-column MVP into a HagentOS-style finance operations console. The main hero title is the AI Agent model name, `JB LocalGuard OS`; the challenge title is kept as contextual metadata, not the primary product title.

## Borrowed System Items

- 4-zone layout: organization rail, sidebar navigation, main work surface, properties panel
- Command bar: natural-language instruction to Orchestrator
- Dashboard metrics: risk, approval, live run, budget
- Case board: TODO, IN PROGRESS, APPROVAL, DONE, BLOCKED
- Approval queue: human-in-the-loop review before external action
- Live AgentRun panel: running agent, linked case, transcript preview
- Agent team: status, reportsTo, heartbeat, queue, mounted skills
- Skill registry: skill type, purpose, risk, approval policy
- Heartbeat routines: scheduled scans and coalesced operational runs
- Activity ledger: audit-style timeline
- Budget page: per-Agent budget consumption
- Settings: organization profile, approval policy, integration adapters
- Jeonse Shield page: jeonse-fraud risk signals, tenant asset exposure, pre-contract checklist, and bank service linkage
- Agent org chart page: shows each AI Agent's reporting line, responsibility, status, budget, and mounted skills

## Visual Direction

The palette follows the attached JB Challenge banner:

- deep navy: command and rail surfaces
- JB blue: primary actions and active states
- cyan: live state, evidence highlights, metric accents
- white: panel surfaces for scanability

## Layout Specification

- organization rail: 72px
- sidebar: 272px desktop, 248px medium
- properties panel: 360px desktop
- page padding: 18px
- page gap: 16px
- card and control radius: 8px

## Added Jeonse Shield Line

The app now includes a separate jeonse-fraud prevention agent line:

- Jeonse Shield Lead
- Deposit Ratio Agent
- Registry Rights Agent
- Tenant Asset Risk Agent
- Contract Checklist Agent
- Bank Linkage Agent

These agents cover high jeonse ratio, excessive deposit versus nearby market, registry rights risk, short-term ownership transfer, guarantee feasibility, tenant asset exposure, pre-contract checklist, special clause drafts, jeonse-loan 상담, guarantee 안내, risky listing warning, and safe-contract guidance.

The UI avoids the academy domain and presents a finance operating system suitable for the free-topic JB future business AI track.
